- Add inline pragmas everywhere! We probably break fusion right now
- Make (Fin n) a valid unboxed (and storable) vector type. It's just a newtype around Int so it should be pretty easy
- Split Fin/Nat into separate package
- Add testsuite
- Avoid almost verbatim duplication in the concrete instance modules (why can't we have parametrzied modules!?!)
